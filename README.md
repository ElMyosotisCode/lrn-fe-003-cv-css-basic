# Misael's F. End Learning Day-03 - "CV ATS Web Page part-03"

Hello... 😃👋🏻  
It's me Misael Randy Limpaty (ElMyosotisCode) your future Front End Developer Expert.

This project is the continuation of "ATS Based CV".

In this progress session, I added CSS basic styling rules, such as: ✌
- CSS Simple Reset
- CSS Variables
- CSS Layout and Positioning
- CSS Box Model
- CSS Typography

--

What I learned in this project is how to add and use CSS external to style my web page and make it look more appealing.
Also I learned how to use CSS variables to make my code more maintainable and easier to read,
and how to use CSS box model to control the layout and positioning of elements on my web page.
